# Handover Plan for the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Team
# Author: Rohan Batra

## Objective

This handover plan is designed to assist the incoming GRC team at Redback Operations in building on the work completed this trimester. It outlines key deliverables, processes, and recommendations to ensure a smooth transition and continued progress.

## 1. Familiarize Yourself with Previous Work

Before starting new tasks, the incoming team should thoroughly review the implementation plans and resources created this trimester. Key documents to focus on include:

- **Implementation Plans** for:
  - Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Data Classification
  - External Attack Surface Management (EASM)
  - Server Security
  - Monitoring and Log Analytics
  - Endpoint Security
  - Cryptography
- **Customizable Audit Template**
- **"How-To Audit" Guide**

These resources will provide a comprehensive understanding of the current GRC framework, security initiatives, and best practices implemented during the last trimester.

## 2. Conduct a Gap Analysis

### First Action After Familiarization

Once the team has familiarized itself with the existing work, the next critical step is to conduct a **gap analysis**. The goal is to identify any areas of the GRC framework or implementation plans that might need further development or improvement. The process includes:

- Reviewing current security measures to identify missing or outdated policies, controls, or procedures.
- Identifying potential vulnerabilities within systems that have not yet been fully addressed.
- Assessing team engagement and the effectiveness of collaboration with other Redback project teams.

The findings from the gap analysis will guide the team in prioritizing future efforts and improving the overall security posture.

## 3. Engage with Other Project Teams

One of the GRC team's ongoing responsibilities is to collaborate with other project teams within Redback Operations to perform audits and provide support. Key steps include:

- Continuing the audit process to ensure adherence to Redback policies and the GRC framework.
- Offering educational support to project teams, ensuring they understand Redback’s GRC framework and security best practices.
- Identifying potential risks or compliance issues within other teams' projects.

Maintaining strong relationships with other project teams will enhance cooperation and ensure a unified approach to security across the company.

## 4. Perform Regular Audits Using the Customizable Audit Template

The customizable audit template developed this trimester provides a streamlined method for auditing different projects within Redback. Moving forward:

- Use the template to perform audits across various teams, customizing it to meet the unique requirements of each project.
- Document audit findings and share results with both the project teams and senior management to address any security gaps.

Reference the "How-To Audit" guide to ensure consistent and thorough auditing procedures.

## 5. Continue Development of the GRC Framework

Although a robust GRC framework has been developed, it is essential to continuously refine and improve upon it. Next steps include:

- Updating the framework as new vulnerabilities or regulatory changes arise.
- Enhancing areas such as cryptography, monitoring, or server security, as needed.

Regularly reviewing and improving the framework ensures that the company remains compliant and secure against evolving threats.

## 6. Reporting and Documentation

Accurate reporting and documentation are crucial for tracking progress and keeping leadership informed. To maintain consistency:

- **Audit Reports:** Document and share the results of each audit with the appropriate stakeholders.
- **Regular Updates:** Provide progress reports to senior management (Ben Stephens, Daniel) on the team’s activities.
- **Task Tracking:** Use tools like Trello to monitor task completion and team productivity.

Ensuring that all reports and updates are comprehensive and well-organized will streamline communication and project tracking.

## 7. Team Collaboration and Leadership

Effective team collaboration will be critical to the success of the GRC team. To maintain this:

- Hold regular team meetings to review progress, delegate tasks, and resolve any issues.
- Continue the **Agile project management** approach used this trimester to ensure accountability and timely completion of tasks.
- Provide mentorship and support to junior team members to help them develop their skills and contribute effectively.

## 8. Future Development of GRC Capabilities

Looking ahead, the incoming team should explore new ways to enhance GRC capabilities, such as:

- Improving threat detection tools used in monitoring and log analytics.
- Expanding data classification efforts to cover more dynamic data environments.
- Organizing knowledge-sharing sessions to improve communication and engagement between the GRC team and other project teams.

## Conclusion

This handover plan provides clear guidance for the incoming GRC team to build on the work done this trimester. Conducting a gap analysis early in the trimester will help the team identify areas for improvement and set clear priorities. By continuing to develop the GRC framework, collaborating with other teams, and leveraging the tools and documentation already in place, the team will be well-prepared for success in the next trimester.
