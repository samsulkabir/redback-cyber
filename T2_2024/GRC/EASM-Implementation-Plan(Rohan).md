# Implementation Plan for EASM

**Author:** Rohan Batra

## 1. Objective and Scope

**Objective**: Develop an easy-to-implement, cost-effective deployment plan for EASM policies and procedures to address identified gaps.

**Scope**: This plan covers all external-facing assets, including web applications, network infrastructure, cloud services, email servers, and remote access services.

## 2. Redefine Policy Adherence Criteria

- **Review Current Policies**: Evaluate existing security policies to identify gaps in adherence criteria.
- **Develop New Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for policy adherence, focusing on critical assets and risk factors.
- **Communication Changes**: Ensure that all stakeholders are informed about the new adherence criteria and understand their importance.

## 3. Redefine Roles and Responsibilities

- **Role Assignment**: Clearly defining roles and responsibilities for EASM implementation, including who will manage, monitor, and enforce which policies.
- **Training**: Providing training sessions to ensure all team members understand their roles and responsibilities.
- **Accountability**: Implement mechanisms for accountability, such as regular reporting and performance evaluations.

## 4. Research and Implement Protection Services

Conduct thorough research to identify suitable protection services for each area:

- **Web-facing Applications and Services**
  - Vulnerability Scanning: Implement regular scanning to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in web applications.
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF to protect against common web-based attacks.

- **Network Infrastructure**
  - Network Monitoring Tools: Use tools to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies in real time.
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Deploy IDS to identify and respond to suspicious activities.

- **Cloud Services and Infrastructure**
  - Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM): Implement CSPM tools to continuously assess cloud security configurations.
  - Access Control: Enforce strict access controls and use identity and access management (IAM) solutions.

- **Email and Communication Servers**
  - Email Filtering Solutions: Use solutions to filter out phishing emails and malware.
  - Encryption: Implement encryption for emails and communications to protect sensitive data.

- **Remote Access Services**
  - Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all remote access services.
  - VPN Solutions: Ensure secure VPN configurations for remote connections.

## 5. Use EASM Policy Methodology

- **Assessment**: Regularly assess the attack surface to identify new assets and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Prioritization**: Prioritize assets based on risk and criticality to the business.
- **Remediation**: Develop and implement remediation plans for identified vulnerabilities, focusing on high-risk areas first.

## 6. Cost Effectiveness

- **Budget Planning**: Develop a budget that outlines costs for tools, services, and personnel.
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Evaluate vendors based on cost-effectiveness and reputation.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Perform a cost-benefit analysis to ensure investments align with risk reduction goals.

## 7. Ease of Implementation

- **Pilot Testing**: Conduct pilot tests to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of solutions before full deployment.
- **Integration**: Ensure that new tools and processes integrate seamlessly with existing systems.
- **Automation**: Leverage automation to streamline processes and reduce manual intervention.

## 8. Adherence to Regulatory Requirements

- **Compliance Check**: Review relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, NIST) to ensure compliance.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of policies, procedures, and compliance efforts.
- **Audit Preparedness**: Prepare for audits by maintaining detailed records of security measures and compliance status.

## 9. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of the EASM program to assess effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop with stakeholders to gather input and refine policies and procedures.
- **Continuous Learning**: Stay informed about emerging threats and technologies to adapt the EASM strategy accordingly.

## 10. Implementation Timeline and Milestones

- **Phase 1: Planning and Preparation (Week 5-6)**
  - Define objectives, roles, and responsibilities.
  - Conduct initial assessments and research.

- **Phase 2: Tool Selection and Pilot Testing (Week 7-8)**
  - Select tools and services.
  - Conduct pilot testing and evaluate results.

- **Phase 3: Full Deployment (Week 9-10)**
  - Deploy solutions across the organization.
  - Provide training and ensure integration.

- **Phase 4: Monitoring and Optimization (Week 10-11)**
  - Monitor effectiveness and optimize processes.
  - Conduct regular assessments and updates.
