## Step-by-Step Guide for Conducting Internal Project Audits

### 1. Preparation

Before starting the audit on any project, gather necessary project-specific documents and resources:

- **Project-Specific Documentation**: You can think of this step as discovery, where you must ensure that you have access to the project’s information assets.
- **Risk Management Documentation for the Project**: Collect the risk management plan, incident logs, and compliance records specific to the project (if they exist).
- **Project Data Protection Policies**: Access data handling and privacy procedures relevant to the project.
- **Book an Interview with the Key Employees**: Schedule an interview with the team leader or any other key employees of your assigned project for the audit.

### 2. Audit Execution

For each audit, break down the process into the following key areas, as outlined in the template. These areas ensure comprehensive project oversight and compliance checks:

#### Governance
1. Confirm that the project team adheres to the company’s governance framework. Review project documents and policies to ensure adherence.
2. Ensure that roles and responsibilities within the project are clearly defined and documented. This can be checked through project plans and team charters.
3. Ensure that decision-making processes within the project are transparent and aligned with company policies. Interview project team leads and review decision logs.

**Audit Action**: Document compliance for each checkpoint in the audit template, marking "Yes" or "No" for each question. Provide observations or comments if necessary, and outline any action required for areas needing improvement.

#### Risk Management
1. Confirm that a documented risk management plan exists for the project and is actively used.
2. Check how risks are identified, assessed, and managed within the project. Review project-specific risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
3. Ensure that risk mitigation strategies are effectively implemented and reviewed over the course of the project.

**Audit Action**: Follow the same format as above, ensuring observations are noted, and actions for non-compliance are outlined.

#### Compliance
1. Verify that the project complies with all applicable laws and regulations. This can include sector-specific or project-specific compliance requirements.
2. Confirm that project team members are trained on compliance requirements. Review training logs for certifications or refreshers.
3. Ensure that regular internal compliance checks specific to the project are conducted and that these audits are documented.

**Audit Action**: Continue documenting compliance for each checkpoint, noting any discrepancies and providing action plans for improvement.

#### Data Protection & Privacy
1. Review how sensitive data is handled within the project and ensure it complies with the company’s data protection policies.
2. Confirm that privacy policies are communicated to all stakeholders involved in the project, including third parties if applicable.
3. Ensure there is a process for responding to data breaches within the project and that it aligns with company-wide standards.

**Audit Action**: Document your findings, focusing on how data protection and privacy measures are implemented for the project. Suggest improvements where necessary.

#### Incident Management
1. Check if an incident response plan specific to the project is in place and whether it has been tested or activated.
2. Review whether incidents related to the project are logged and used for continuous improvement. This includes both security and operational incidents.
3. Verify that lessons learned from incidents are incorporated into the project’s policies and procedures.

**Audit Action**: Record findings and provide recommendations to enhance incident management for the project if gaps are found.

### 3. Post-Audit Actions

After completing the review for all areas:
- Summarize findings in the **Findings and Recommendations** section of the audit template.
- For any non-compliant areas, provide clear actionable steps along with deadlines for when compliance should be achieved.
- Highlight any critical issues that may require immediate action by project leads or the company’s GRC team.

### 4. Reporting

Prepare a final report using the audit template, which includes compliance statuses, observations, and any recommended actions. Schedule a debriefing meeting with project stakeholders, including the project manager and relevant team members, to present findings and discuss next steps.

### Best Practices for Project-Specific Audits

- **Tailor the Audit to the Project**: Each project may have unique governance, risk, and compliance requirements. Ensure you adapt your audit approach based on the project’s specific needs.
- **Use Interviews**: Engage with project team members and leads to validate that processes are being followed and that policies are understood.
- **Verify with Evidence**: Always back your audit findings with documented evidence such as project records, logs, and interviews.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Audits should not only highlight areas of non-compliance but also recommend improvements to governance, risk management, and compliance processes.

This guide is designed to ensure consistency in how audits are performed across different projects within Redback Operations, helping maintain high standards of governance, risk management, and compliance across all projects.

This step-by-step guide should be referred to for any future audits conducted within the company on different projects ensuring each project is thoroughly reviewed and adheres to company standards. Please find the sample audit template attached to the end of this document.
