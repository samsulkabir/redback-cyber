Comprehensive Social Engineering Campaign Plan
Objective
To evaluate and enhance employees' awareness and handling of social engineering attacks through phishing emails, phone calls (vishing), and physical methods like dropping USB drives.
Tools
• GoPhish: A phishing simulation tool to create and manage phishing campaigns.
• SET (Social-Engineer Toolkit): A suite of tools designed for various social engineering attacks, including email phishing and vishing.
Phishing Campaign
1. Research and Design
Objective: Create phishing emails that mimic common legitimate communications to assess employee susceptibility.
Approach: Identify common legitimate emails such as HR announcements, IT support notifications, and corporate communications. Analyze their structure, language, and design to replicate them accurately.
Example Scenarios:
•	• HR Announcements: Emails about new company policies, benefits updates, or mandatory training.
•	• IT Support: Password reset requests, security updates, or account verification emails.
2. Phishing Simulation Tool
Tool: Utilize a phishing simulation tool like GoPhish to automate the distribution and tracking of phishing emails.
Setup: Configure the tool with the designed email templates and target employee groups. Schedule the email dispatch for optimal testing times.
3. Monitoring and Data Collection
Metrics: Track key metrics such as email open rates, click-through rates, and information submission rates.
Data Collection: Gather detailed data on employee interactions with the phishing emails to identify patterns and vulnerabilities.
4. Effectiveness Evaluation
Scenario Analysis: Compare the effectiveness of different phishing scenarios to determine which types of emails are more likely to deceive employees.
Target Group Analysis: Assess the susceptibility of different employee groups (e.g., by department, seniority) to identify high-risk areas.
5. Reporting
Findings: Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the campaign's findings, including statistical data and patterns observed.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations for improving email security awareness and reducing susceptibility to phishing attacks. Suggest targeted training programs and policy updates.
Vishing Campaign
1. Script Development
Objective: Create convincing vishing scripts to test employees' response to phone-based social engineering attacks.
Approach: Tailor scripts to different scenarios such as IT suft5et5 fer4 swtpport calls, customer service inquiries, or urgent security alerts.
Example Scenarios:
•	• IT Support: Calls requesting verification of login details due to a suspected breach.
•	• Customer Service: Calls seeking personal information for account verification or troubleshooting.
2. Ethical and Legal Compliance
Guidelines: Ensure all vishing activities comply with ethical guidelines and legal regulations. Obtain necessary approvals and inform relevant stakeholders about the campaign.
Privacy: Maintain employee privacy and confidentiality throughout the process.
3. Conducting Vishing Calls
Execution: Perform vishing calls using the developed scripts. Ensure a realistic and convincing delivery to effectively test employees' responses.
Outcome Recording: Document the outcomes of each call, noting instances of successful information extraction, employee denial, or suspicion.
4. Effectiveness Analysis
Script Evaluation: Analyze the effectiveness of different vishing scripts to identify which scenarios are more likely to succeed.
Responsiveness Analysis: Assess the responsiveness of different employee groups to identify high-risk areas and potential weaknesses.
5. Reporting
Findings: Compile a detailed report on the vishing campaign's findings, including call outcomes and patterns observed.
Recommendations: Provide recommendations for enhancing phone security practices, such as implementing stricter verification procedures and conducting regular awareness training.
USB Drop Campaign
1. Preparation
Objective: Test employees' reactions to finding and using suspicious USB drives.
Approach: Prepare USB drives with harmless files labeled as sensitive information (e.g., "Confidential_Salary_Report.pdf").
Labeling: Ensure USB drives are convincingly labeled to entice curiosity.
2. Deployment
Location: Strategically place USB drives in common areas (e.g., parking lots, restrooms, break rooms).
Monitoring: Track which drives are picked up and connected to the network.
3. Data Collection
Metrics: Monitor the number of USB drives picked up and connected to employee computers.
Analysis: Evaluate the potential security risk posed by employees connecting unknown USB drives to their workstations.
4. Reporting
Findings: Document the results, including the number of USB drives picked up and used.
Recommendations: Suggest improvements to physical security awareness, such as not using unknown USB drives and reporting suspicious devices.
Comprehensive Reporting and Recommendations
1. Consolidated Report
Data Analysis: Integrate findings from phishing, vishing, and USB drop campaigns into a single comprehensive report.
Statistics: Include detailed statistics on response rates, success rates, and identified vulnerabilities.
Patterns: Highlight patterns and trends observed across different employee groups and scenarios.
2. Actionable Recommendations
Training Programs: Develop targeted training programs based on identified weaknesses.
Policy Updates: Suggest updates to security policies and procedures to address the vulnerabilities discovered.
Continuous Improvement: Recommend regular social engineering testing and training to maintain high levels of security awareness.
